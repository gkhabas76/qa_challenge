#### 1. How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

--> I spend around 1 hour on the technical test. If I had more time or spend more time on the test, I would surely work on saving local storage session on every test run. And also properly integrate CI/CD using GitHub Actions.

#### 2. What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?

--> In my opinion, the usage of Artificial Intelligenece (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) tools or building the AI/ML models test automation is the most interesting trend. Surely, AI/ML technology for test automation will advanced in near future.

#### 3. How would you approach adding automated testing to an existing (web) application with no existing E2E tests? Have you ever had to do this?

--> If the application has not changed since the last release, I would use approval testing to an existing application with no E2E tests. Approval testing is useful to verify all the small details of the application.
I have never had to do this.
